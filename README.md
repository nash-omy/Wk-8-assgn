# Library Management System

## Description
-- This project is a Library Management System built using MySQL.
-- The system is designed to streamline the management of books, users, loans, authors, and categories in a library.
-- It tracks which books are checked out, their due dates, and how many books are available for lending.

-- How to Run/Set Up the Project:
-- 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
-- 2. Open MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL client), then run the script `library_management.sql` to set up the database and tables.
-- 3. After executing the script, the tables will be created, and sample data will be populated.
-- 4. You can now start using the database or perform tests by querying the library's data.
